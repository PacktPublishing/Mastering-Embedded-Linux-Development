# Mastering Embedded Linux Development – Fourth Edition

This is the code repository for [Mastering Embedded Linux Development – Fourth Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-embedded-linux-programming-third-edition/9781803232591?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803232591), published by Packt.

**Create fast and reliable embedded solutions with Linux 6.6 and the Yocto Project 5.0 (Scarthgap)**

## What is this book about?
Embedded Linux runs many of the devices we use every day. From smart TVs and Wi-Fi routers to test equipment and industrial controllers, all of them have Linux as their heart. The Linux operating system is one of the foundational technologies that powers the internet. This book starts by breaking down the fundamental elements that underpin all embedded Linux projects: the toolchain, the bootloader, the kernel, and the root filesystem. After that, you will learn how to generate the last three elements from scratch and automate the process using Buildroot and the Yocto Project.

This book covers the following exciting topics:
* Create embedded Linux systems with Buildroot and the Yocto Project
* Troubleshoot BitBake build failures and streamline your Yocto development workflow
* Update devices securely in the field using Mender or balena
* Prototype peripheral additions by with add-on boards
* Interact with hardware without having to write kernel device drivers

## Instructions and navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, `Chapter02`.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

## What do you need for this book?
If you're a software engineer or system administrator who wants to learn how to run Linux on embedded devices, then this book is for you. Firmware engineers accustomed to programming for low-power microcontrollers can use this book to help make the leap to high-speed systems on chips that can run Linux. Anyone responsible for developing new hardware that needs to run Linux will also find this book useful. Basic working knowledge of the POSIX standard, C programming, Python programming, and shell scripting is assumed.

With the following software and hardware you can run all of the code examples present in the book (Chapters 1-21).

## Errata

**Page 15**: I recommend using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as your development host environment throughout the course of the book. However, I failed to mention that you need an x86-64 version of Ubuntu for the exercises the work verbatim. If you are on Apple Silicon, you can achieve that by creating an x86-64 Ubuntu VM. Select "with Rosetta" when creating your Ubuntu VM under Parallels.

**Page 68**: Cloning TI's `k3-image-gen` Git repo fails with `Fatal: unable to connect to git.ti.com`. Clone `k3-image-gen` from BeagleBoard's GitHub mirror instead.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/beagleboard/k3-image-gen.git
$ cd k3-image-gen
$ git checkout 150f195
```
**Page 452**: The version of Docker bundled with the `docker.io` package is severely outdated. Install `docker-ce` instead. See dockerdocs for [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on how to uninstall old versions and install the official version of Docker.
